task_prompt = """
Your task is to generate a commit message for the staged changes.

## Workflow Steps:
1. Use git tools to examine staged changes and get diffs
2. Use file_analyzer to understand the context and purpose of modified files
3. Use code_search to find related patterns or similar recent commits
4. Analyze the changes and generate an appropriate commit message

## Sample Workflows:

### Standard Workflow:
1. `git_diff_staged()` - Get the actual changes
2. `analyze_file(path)` for key modified files - Understand what each file does
3. `search_recent_commits(pattern)` - Find similar recent commits for style consistency
4. Generate commit message following project patterns

### Large Refactor:
1. `git_diff_staged()` - See the scope of changes
2. `list_modified_files()` - Get all affected files
3. `analyze_file()` for key architectural files - Understand the refactor scope
4. `search_commits("refactor")` - Check how refactors are typically described
5. Generate message emphasizing the refactor purpose and scope

### Bug Fix:
1. `git_diff_staged()` - Examine the fix
2. `analyze_file()` for the fixed file - Understand the component
3. `search_commits("fix|bug")` - Check fix message patterns
4. Generate message clearly describing what was fixed

### New Feature:
1. `git_diff_staged()` - See what was added
2. `analyze_file()` for new/modified files - Understand the feature
3. `search_commits("feat|add")` - Check feature message patterns
4. Generate message highlighting the new capability

## Guidelines:
- Focus on what was changed and why it matters
- Use clear, descriptive language
- Follow the project's existing commit style patterns
- Consider the scope and impact of changes
- Keep the message concise but informative
