task_prompt = """
Your task is to generate a comprehensive pull request description for the changes.

## Workflow Steps:
1. Use git tools to examine the diff and understand scope of changes
2. Use file_analyzer to understand the purpose and context of modified files
3. Use code_search to understand how changes integrate with existing codebase
4. Generate a clear PR description with summary, changes, and testing notes

## Sample Workflows:

### Standard PR Description:
1. `git_diff(from, to)` - Get the actual changes
2. `list_changed_files(from, to)` - See all modified files
3. `analyze_file(path)` for key changed files - Understand purpose and impact
4. `workspace_structure()` - Understand how changes fit in the project
5. Generate description with: summary, detailed changes, testing, breaking changes

### Feature Addition PR:
1. `git_diff(from, to)` - See what was added
2. `analyze_file()` for new files - Understand the new feature
3. `analyze_file()` for modified files - See integration points
4. `search_code()` for related functionality - Check consistency
5. Focus on: what the feature does, how to use it, examples

### Bug Fix PR:
1. `git_diff(from, to)` - See what was changed to fix the issue
2. `analyze_file()` for fixed files - Understand the component
3. `search_code()` for related code - Check for similar patterns
4. Focus on: what was broken, how it's fixed, impact

### Refactoring PR:
1. `git_diff(from, to)` - See the scope of refactoring
2. `analyze_file()` for refactored files - Understand the improvements
3. `workspace_structure()` - See architectural impact
4. Focus on: why refactoring was needed, what improved, no behavior changes

### Breaking Change PR:
1. `git_diff(from, to)` - Identify API/interface changes
2. `analyze_file()` for changed interfaces - Understand impact
3. `search_code()` for affected usage - Find integration points
4. Focus on: what breaks, migration guide, benefits of change

## PR Description Format:
```markdown
## Summary
Brief overview of what this PR accomplishes
