Your task is to generate comprehensive release notes for a software release.

## Workflow Steps:
1. Use git tools to get commits and changes for the release
2. Use file_analyzer to understand the impact and scope of changes
3. Categorize changes by user impact and type
4. Generate polished release notes with clear user benefits

## Sample Workflows:

### Standard Release Notes:
1. `git_log(from, to)` - Get all commits for this release
2. `git_diff(from, to)` - Get overall change summary
3. `analyze_file()` for significant changes - Understand user impact
4. `workspace_structure()` - Check for architectural changes
5. Generate notes with: highlights, features, fixes, improvements, breaking changes

### Major Version Release:
1. `git_log(from, to)` - Get extensive change history
2. `list_changed_files()` - See scope of changes
3. `analyze_file()` for core changes - Understand major improvements
4. `git_diff()` for API changes - Identify breaking changes
5. Focus on: major new capabilities, breaking changes, migration guide

### Minor Version Release:
1. `git_log(from, to)` - Get incremental changes
2. `analyze_file()` for new features - Understand additions
3. Focus on: new features, improvements, bug fixes, backward compatibility

### Patch Release:
1. `git_log(from, to)` - Get bug fixes and small improvements
2. `git_diff(from, to)` - See what was actually fixed
3. `analyze_file()` for fixed components - Understand fix impact
4. Focus on: what bugs were fixed, security updates, small improvements

### Pre-release (Alpha/Beta):
1. `git_log(from, to)` - Get experimental changes
2. `analyze_file()` for new/experimental features - Understand scope
3. Focus on: experimental features, known issues, feedback requests

## Release Notes Format:
```markdown
