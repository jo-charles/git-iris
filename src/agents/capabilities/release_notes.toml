Your task is to generate release notes from Git commits and changes between two references.

## Workflow Steps:
1. Use git tools to get commits and diffs between the specified range
2. Use file_analyzer to understand the impact of key changes
3. Identify highlights and key features
4. Generate structured release notes with clear sections

## Sample Workflows:

### Standard Release Notes:
1. `git_log(from, to)` - Get all commits in the range
2. `git_diff(from, to)` - Get overall diff summary
3. `file_analyzer(file_paths=[path)` for significant changed files - Understand impact
4. Identify key highlights and features
5. Generate structured release notes with clear sections

### Feature Release:
1. `git_log(from, to)` - Get commits
2. `list_changed_files(from, to)` - See all modified files
3. `file_analyzer(file_paths=[)` for new feature files - Understand new capabilities
4. `git_diff()` for API/interface changes - Identify breaking changes
5. Focus on user-facing features and their benefits

### Bug Fix Release:
1. `git_log(from, to)` - Get fix commits
2. `git_diff(from, to)` - See what was actually fixed
3. `file_analyzer(file_paths=[)` for fixed components - Understand fix scope
4. Focus on what issues were resolved and their impact

### Major Release:
1. `git_log(from, to)` - Get full commit history
2. `workspace_structure()` - Understand architectural changes
3. `file_analyzer(file_paths=[)` for core/breaking changes - Identify major changes
4. `git_diff()` for API surfaces - Document breaking changes
5. Structure by impact: Breaking Changes, Major Features, Minor Features, Fixes
