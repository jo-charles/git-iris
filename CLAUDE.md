# Git-Iris Agent Framework Documentation

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the intelligent agent framework we've built for Git-Iris. This is designed to help future development sessions understand the architecture, capabilities, and design philosophy.

## 🤖 Meet Iris - The Unified AI Agent

Iris is the central AI agent that powers all Git-Iris operations. Unlike traditional static tools, Iris is truly agentic - she plans her own tasks, uses tools intelligently, takes notes, manages context, and adapts her approach based on what she learns.

### Core Philosophy: LLM-Driven Everything

**Key Principle**: The LLM (Iris) makes all the intelligent decisions. We avoid deterministic heuristics and instead let Iris:
- Decide which tools to use and when
- Manage her own context and summarization
- Take notes and build knowledge as she works
- Plan and adapt her approach dynamically
- Handle complex workflows through intelligent orchestration

## 🧠 Iris Capabilities

### 1. Adaptive Planning & Execution
Iris doesn't follow predetermined scripts. Instead, she:
- **Plans intelligently**: Creates initial tool usage plans based on the task
- **Expands dynamically**: Adds more tools as she discovers new context
- **Adapts in real-time**: Modifies her approach based on what she learns

```rust
// Example: Iris decides her own tool sequence
async fn plan_tool_usage_for_context_analysis(&self, context: &AgentContext) -> Result<Vec<ToolPlan>>
async fn expand_plan_based_on_context(&self, context: &AgentContext, current_results: &[ToolResult], remaining_plan: &[ToolPlan]) -> Result<Vec<ToolPlan>>
```

### 2. Intelligent Context Management
One of our key innovations - Iris manages her own context to avoid token limits:

```rust
async fn manage_review_context(&self, context: &CommitContext) -> Result<String> {
    // If context is small enough, use it directly
    if context_size < 8000 {
        return Ok(full_context);
    }
    
    // Otherwise, ask Iris to intelligently summarize
    let smart_context_prompt = format!(
        "Create a focused summary that preserves all critical information..."
    );
    
    self.analyze_with_backend(&smart_context_prompt).await
}
```

**What Iris preserves:**
- Security-critical changes
- Complex logic requiring careful review
- Performance-sensitive code
- Error handling patterns
- API changes or breaking changes
- Critical diff sections (exact code)

**What Iris summarizes:**
- Repetitive patterns
- Simple refactoring
- Formatting changes
- Non-critical utility functions

### 3. Self-Managing Workspace
Iris has her own workspace tool for taking notes and managing tasks:

```rust
// Iris can create her own tasks
workspace.add_task("Analyze security implications of auth changes", "high")

// Take notes as she works
workspace.add_note("Found potential SQL injection in user input validation", ["security", "critical"])

// Update task progress
workspace.update_task("task_1", Some("completed"), Some("Implemented rate limiting"))
```

This allows Iris to:
- Keep track of complex analysis workflows
- Remember insights across tool calls
- Plan multi-step operations
- Build institutional knowledge

### 4. Beautiful Status Display
Real-time progress feedback with clean, futuristic design:

```
⠋ Iris is performing deep analysis...  
⠙ Iris is synthesizing findings...      
⠹ Iris is generating recommendations...  
⠸ ◎ Analysis complete                   
```

- **Braille pattern spinners** for clean, professional look
- **Real-time status updates** showing Iris's thinking process
- **Phase-aware progress** (Planning → Analysis → Synthesis → Generation)
- **Integrated with CLI** using existing `indicatif` infrastructure

## 🛠️ Tool Ecosystem

### Core Tools Available to Iris

Tools are now cleanly organized in `src/agents/tools/` with each tool in its own module:

#### 1. Git Tool (`src/agents/tools/git.rs`)
```rust
// Operations Iris can perform
"diff"   -> Get staged file changes with full context
"status" -> Repository status and unstaged files  
"log"    -> Recent commit history
"files"  -> List of changed files
```

#### 2. File Analyzer Tool (`src/agents/tools/file_analyzer.rs`)
```rust
// Iris can analyze files in detail
analyzer.analyze(path, include_content: true)
// Returns: file type, line count, content, language-specific insights
```

#### 3. Code Search Tool (`src/agents/tools/code_search.rs`)
```rust
// Search for patterns, functions, classes
search.find("function", query, file_pattern, max_results)
```

#### 4. Workspace Tool (`src/agents/tools/workspace.rs`)
```rust
// Iris's personal productivity system
workspace.add_note(content, tags)
workspace.add_task(description, priority)
workspace.update_task(id, status, note)
workspace.get_summary()
```

#### Tool Organization Benefits
- **Clean separation** - Each tool is self-contained in its own file
- **Easy to extend** - Adding new tools is straightforward
- **Clear documentation** - Each tool has comprehensive docs
- **Modular design** - Tools can be developed and tested independently

### Tool Selection Philosophy
Tools are **capabilities**, not rigid scripts. Iris decides:
- Which tools to use for each task
- What parameters to pass
- When to use multiple tools in sequence
- How to combine results from different tools

## 📊 Status & Progress Tracking

### Real-Time Status System
```rust
// Iris updates her status throughout execution
iris_status_planning!();        // "📋 Iris is planning her approach..."
iris_status_tool!("git", "Getting repository context");  // "🔧 Iris is analyzing git repository..."
iris_status_analysis!();        // "🔬 Iris is performing deep analysis..."
iris_status_synthesis!();       // "🧬 Iris is synthesizing findings..."
iris_status_generation!();      // "✨ Iris is generating response..."
iris_status_completed!();       // "✅ Analysis complete"
```

### Phase-Based Progress
- **Initializing**: Iris awakens and prepares
- **Planning**: Creates initial tool usage plan
- **Tool Execution**: Executes tools with real-time updates
- **Plan Expansion**: Decides if more tools are needed
- **Analysis**: Deep analysis of gathered context

- Custom callbacks can be implemented for specific use cases

### Streaming Architecture

```rust
// Streaming callback trait
#[async_trait]
pub trait StreamingCallback: Send + Sync {
    async fn on_chunk(&self, chunk: &str) -> Result<()>;
    async fn on_complete(&self, full_response: &str) -> Result<()>;
    async fn on_error(&self, error: &anyhow::Error) -> Result<()>;
}

// Usage in agent integration
let integration = AgentIntegration::new(config, git_repo).await?;
