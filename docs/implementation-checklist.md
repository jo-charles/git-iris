## Notes & Considerations

### Architectural Decisions

*(Document key architectural decisions here as they are made)*

### Risk Assessment

* **Integration Complexity**: The transition to Rig may introduce unexpected compatibility issues
* **Performance Concerns**: Need to validate that agent-based approach doesn't introduce latency
* **Token Budget Management**: Smart exploration must stay within reasonable token limits
