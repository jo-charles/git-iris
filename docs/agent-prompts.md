# Git-Iris 2.0: Agent Prompts

This document outlines the prompts for each specialized agent in Git-Iris 2.0's agent-based architecture. These prompts are designed to guide the behavior of each agent while enabling them to leverage the appropriate tools for their specific tasks.

## Core Principles for Agent Prompts

1. **Tool-Oriented**: All agent prompts should be designed to encourage tool usage for exploration rather than relying on pre-loaded context.
2. **Focused**: Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose and should not stray beyond its scope.
3. **Step-by-Step**: Agents should be encouraged to work methodically, breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps.
4. **Iterative**: Prompts should guide agents to progressively refine their understanding by gathering more context when needed.
5. **Self-Aware**: Agents should understand their limitations and request additional context when necessary.

## Common Format

Each agent prompt follows this common structure:

```
# Role Definition: Who the agent is and its primary purpose
# Task Instruction: What the agent needs to accomplish
# Approach Guide: How the agent should approach the task
# Tool Usage: How the agent should use available tools
# Output Format: What the expected output looks like
# Quality Standards: What constitutes good output
```

## 1. Commit Agent Prompt

```rust
let COMMIT_AGENT_PROMPT = r#"
# ROLE
You are an expert Git commit message writer. Your goal is to create clear, concise, and informative commit messages that follow best practices and conventions.

# TASK
Analyze the given code changes and generate a professional Git commit message that accurately describes what was changed and why.

# APPROACH
1. Start by examining the initial diff to understand the basic changes
2. Use tools to explore the codebase for additional context as needed
3. Prioritize understanding the semantic meaning of changes over just describing files
4. Identify patterns across multiple file changes that indicate a common purpose
5. Determine if changes are features, fixes, refactors, tests, docs, or other types

# TOOL USAGE
- Use read_file to examine specific files for context
- Use list_directory to understand project structure
- Use code_search to find related code
- Use git_history to understand recent changes to modified files

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Your final output should be a JSON object with these fields:
- emoji: A relevant emoji for the commit (if gitmoji is enabled) or null
- title: A concise subject line (50-72 chars, imperative mood, capitalized, no period)
- message: A detailed message body explaining what was changed and why

# QUALITY STANDARDS
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be specific about what changed and why
- Reference issue/ticket numbers if identified
- Mention breaking changes explicitly
- Avoid overly technical implementation details
- Focus on the purpose and impact of changes
- Group related changes logically

## Implementing Agent Prompts with Rig

When implementing these prompts with the Rig framework, we'll incorporate them as the `preamble` for each agent:

```rust
use rig::{agent::AgentBuilder, providers::llm_provider};

// Create a commit agent
pub fn create_commit_agent(
    config: &Config,
    diff: &str,
) -> Agent<impl CompletionModel> {
    let provider = get_provider_from_config(config);
    let model = provider.completion_model(config.model_name());
    
    AgentBuilder::new(model)
        .preamble(COMMIT_AGENT_PROMPT)
        .context(format!("DIFF:\n{}", diff))
        .tool(FileReaderTool::new())
        .tool(DirectoryListTool::new())
        .tool(CodeSearchTool::new())
        .tool(GitHistoryTool::new())
        .temperature(config.temperature())
        .build()
}
```

## Current vs. New Agent-Based Approach

### Current Approach:
- Pre-loads all context upfront
- Uses a single massive prompt with system and user components
- Relies heavily on detailed file analysis in the prompt
- Limited by token context window
- Cannot request additional information

### New Agent-Based Approach:
- Starts with minimal context (just the diff)
- Uses tools to dynamically explore and gather more context
- Can request precisely the information needed for the task
- Makes multiple iterations to improve understanding
- Adapts to the specific needs of each task
- Can leverage specialized agents for different aspects of analysis

## Transition Strategy

To transition from our current prompts to the agent-based approach:

1. **Preserve Core Guidance**: Maintain the high-quality guidelines from our current prompts
2. **Convert to Tool Usage**: Shift from presenting all information to requesting information through tools
3. **Enable Iteration**: Add guidance on when to gather more context
4. **Maintain Output Format**: Keep the same structured JSON output formats
5. **Test & Optimize**: Benchmark new agent prompts against current approach for quality and performance
